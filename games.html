	    					<p>Robot Rocket Racer is a single player Virtual Reality game for the HTC Vive.  You are a new class of AI, with intelligence far beyond any robot made before you, and your creator wants you to compete in the upcoming Robot Racing World Championship!  Use your thrusters to soar through the air in training races against the obsolete robots to prepare for the upcoming races!</p>

	    					<p>The major gameplay mechanics in RRR resemble a party racing game, like Mario Kart.  The player flys around with rocket thrusters much like Iron Man.  Items are scattered across the map, allowing the player to get a boost or attack the enemy racers.  Rings also provide a boost, but aren't required to complete the course.  Any path is a valid one, and using powerups to make shortcuts is a key strategy.</p>

	    					<h3  class="text-center">Design Process</h3>
	    					<p>RRR was made as an exploration of locomotion in VR.  For many reasons, other modes of transportation in VR are unsatisfactory.  When you strap on a VR headset, are stepping into a world with truly infinite possiblilties.  Yet so many locomotion mechanics, expecially those for roomscale VR, feel so limiting.  If VR is to truly be successful, we need locomotion mechanics which empower players to do what they couldn't in real life.  To be clear, this doesn't mean they should mimic reality, but should aim to possess some of the same key qualities that natural motion has, to prevent disorientation and sickness.  Furthermore, they should not be more restrictive than natural movement.</p>

	    					<p>Keeping these guidlines in mind, we developed the thruster mechanic in RRR.  It allows players to fly, controlled by the tracked controllers that come with the HTC Vive.  A thruster is attached to each controller, and a thrust is applied to the center of mass of the player based on the direction the thrusters were pointed.  All rotation of the player is locked, so players must physically turn their bodies to turn in the game.  This alone prevents most motion sickness and disorientation.</p>

	    					<div class="col-md-6">
	    						<img src="images/games/thrusters-1.png" width=98% class="img-rounded">
	    					</div>
	    					<div class="col-md-6">
	    						<img src="images/games/thrusters-2.png" width=98% class="img-rounded">
	    					</div>
	    					<br>
	    					<p>Experimentation was done between two thruster physics models.  The most obvious and intuitive is the isotropic model, in which a force is exerted in the direction the thruster faces.  However, in RRR I wanted to emphasize horizontal over vertical movement.  This is because going down was the slowest part of the game, and I wanted to punish players less harshly to errors in the angle in which they held the contoller.  The way I did that then, was to scale a unit vector extending from the thruster independently in the horizontal and vertical directions.  This system is much less obvious, so extensive testing was performed to ensure that there was no performance difference between the models.  You can read more about that testing in  <a href = "VANCISE_FINAL_GO_FORTH.pdf">this paper I wrote.</a>  The anisotropic model was selected, for the reasons mentioned above.
	    					<br>
	    					<br>
	    					I mentioned earlier that rotation was locked, so the player had to use their feet to turn.  This was at first due to motion sickness concerns.  However, I did develop a method to turn slowly by tilting your head and arms like you are banking a turn.  This was intuitive and obvious for players, and caused no motion sickness due to the slow nature of the turning.  Playtesters loved it, as it was perfect for making small adjustments that were more difficult with the feet.
	    					<br>
	    					<br>
	    					As useful as it was this feature did not survive.  It was important to recognize the feature's overall impact on user experience.  Previously, I had noticed how easy it was to tangle the cord of the Vive when flying in a loop.  For that reason, we designed all of our levels so that the player wouldn't get tangled, using mostly figure 8's and S's.  As soon as we introduced the turning mechanic, players would now have the opportunity of getting tangled in the cable simply by playing the levels as we intended.  So then, it was obvious that we could only have one turning mechanic if we wanted to prevent getting tangled, so the turning mechanic was cut from the locomotion.
	    					</p>

	    					<br>
	    					
	    					<p>Being a racing game, a big challenge we faced was displaying race information to the player (i.e. position, lap, what item they had, etc.).  It was originally theorized that a HUD, similar to what you would see in the Iron Man movies, would do the trick.  However, objects on the HUD were hard to focus on in a quick glance, and were overall more distracting and motion-sickening than helpful.  To remedy the race information problem, I put the info at a distance, so the player only has to focus their eyes on objects of similar distances.
	    					<br>

	    					</div>
	    					<br>
	    					The race position was moved by labelling the other racers, so you now can infer your own position.  The reticle was changed to a laser sight that the player could turn on and off, and its appearance (color and particle effect) changed based on the item you picked up.  These solutions were by no means perfect, but large improvements over the HUD system.
	    					</p>
	    					<h3  class="text-center">Future Plans</h3>
	    					<p>The future of RRR is as of now, undecided.  A subset of the team, lead by myself, intends to continue working on a VR title.  We may continue developing levels for this title, or we may start a new game, learning from the flaws of RRR, and designing gameplay more suited for VR.  Our original desire to show that VR locomotion should be empowering will be at the core of our efforts moving forward.

	    					<p>Spectrum is a top-down, 2D shooter made in Unity.  You can move only on your team's territory. Shooting acts as both a combat and movement mechanism, as your shots paint the ground underneath them.</p>
	    					<p>The uniqueness of Spectrum lies in its scoring system.  When you are hit, instead of dying and respawning, you are converted to the team of the player who shot you.  A round is over when all players are on the same team.  You are awarded points for how many conversions you get and how early you were on the winning team.</p>

	    					<h3  class="text-center">Design Process</h3>
	    					<p>The design assignment was to create a game where many people could share one screen to play a game together. Much experimentation surrounded what inputs should be used in this type of top-down shooter. We needed something simple, because the assignement constraints required us to create a mobile app to act as the controller.  Using a touchscreen, without looking at it, only lends itself to one button and one joystick, or two joysticks.  Early prototypes were implemented using xbox controllers, but at the end of the semester we were using the mobile phone controllers supporting up to 8 players.

	    					The core gameplay consists of shooting to convert enemies, and shooting to expand your territory (and therefore aid movement).  This dual purpose shot lent itself to being controlled with limited inputs, which we thought made it perfect for our mobile phone controllers.  However, once we made the switch, many issues began to arise regarding the player's ability to control his movement.  Because the original movement mechanic was not very forgiving to the player, combining it with an innacurate input method only caused headaches for the players.  We did our best to make the system more forgiving, but never really achieved the fluidity that we would have liked.
	    					<br>
	    					<br>
	    					After the semester ended, <a href="http://samueli.xyz/" target='_blank'>Samuel Inman</a> and myself pushed Spectrum beyond the classroom and its initial prototype.  We decided to go back to standard console controllers because it allowed the design to have a tighter movement mechanic, while also providing more buttons to handle the desperately needed additional combat mechanics.  In an effort to give the combat more depth, we designed a second shooting mechanic, a selection of powerups, and new maps.  We designed these mechanics for up to 8 players, while also working for smaller groups.
	    					<br>
	    					<br>
	    					To reduce the spamming of close combat, I created a long-ranged shot to punish those who got into long, button mashing combat sessions.  Unlike the normal shot, the longshot cannot be blocked, only dodged.  To balance this, a player must take time to charge the longshot before he can use it.

	    					<p style="clear:both"><br>In addition to new shot and dodge mechanics, we really wanted to highlight our unique scoring system to the player.  To accomplish this, we added a new menu and improved the scoreboard. The new menu gives players some agency in determining exactly how score is calculated, while also showcasing some of the reason behind different score equations.  The scoreboard highlights how points were earned, and emphasizes both how early you were on the team and number of conversions.
	    					<br>
	    					<br>
	    					In the gameplay above, you will notice a few signifiers during play about how the score sytem works.  In the initial prototypes, all the players were the same shape, and all the players on the same team were the same color.  I added shapes so it was easier to distinguish yourself in a more hectic combat scenario.  I realized players weren't looking at the color of themseleves to determine where they could move, only the boundaries of the color they were on.  This meant that players of the same team were not required to be the same color.  As a signifier to how early you were on the team, I adjust the brightness and saturation of the colors create a spectrum of colors on the same team, clearly displaying each player's rank within the team.
	    					<br>
	    					<br>
	    					These changes led to a few interesting developments in gameplay.  Player shape allowed the recognition of winning during gameplay by seeing the scoreboard with players shapes between rounds. This is turn means players can team up against the leader to ensure he doesn't win.  The shade signifier of the earliness on the team afforded players a way to tell how good someone was playing within the round itself, to aid in the takedown of another specific player.
	    					<br>
	    					<br>
	    					The powerup system balances this dynamic by giving players powerful weapons designed to take down a group of people working closely together rather than in 1 on 1 combat which develops early in the round.
	    					<br>
	    					<br>
	    					This game is currently still in production, but most of the design is finalized.  We intend to launch soon, so you will be able to play with all of your friends.  Depending on interest, we may add full online play functionality.
